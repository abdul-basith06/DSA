# ğŸ§  Problem: Two Sum
# ğŸ”¹ Problem Statement
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.
###
# ğŸ”¸ Example:
# Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
# Output: [0, 1]
# Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 2 + 7 == 9
###
# âœ… Approach (Hash Map - O(n) Time, O(n) Space):
# - Use a dictionary (hash map) to store numbers and their indices as we iterate.
# - For each number, compute its complement: `target - num`.
# - If the complement is already in the map, return its index and current index.
# - Else, store the number with its index in the map.
# - This avoids nested loops and ensures linear time.

        if diff in lookup:

        lookup[num] = i
    return []
