# ðŸ§  Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
# ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement:
# You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

# You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

# Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If no profit can be made, return 0.

###

# âœ… Approach:
# - Initialize `min_price` as infinity and `max_profit` as 0.
# - Iterate through the list of prices:
#     - If current price is less than `min_price`, update `min_price`.
#     - Else calculate `profit = price - min_price`
#         - If `profit` is greater than `max_profit`, update `max_profit`, `buy_price`, and `sell_price`.
# - This ensures we always buy before we sell and get the best profit.
# - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1)
